    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p><em>You will need <span class="need">to prepare this</span></em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stand mixer with dough hook attachment, or medium bowl and muscle </li>
        <li>power</li>
        <li>Stiff spatula</li>
        <li>Plastic wrap or other covering for the bowl</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup lukewarm water (not hot)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active-dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="Instructions">
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Dissolve the yeast in the water. Pour the water into the bowl of a stand
            mixer or a medium bowl. Sprinkle the yeast over the water, and let stand until
            the yeast has dissolved, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour and salt to form a shaggy dough. Add the flour and salt.
            Stir with a stiff spatula until you’ve formed a floury, shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 5 minutes. Using the dough hook on the stand
            mixer, or kneading by hand against the counter, knead the dough on medium speed
            until it forms a smooth, slightly tacky ball that springs back when you poke it,
            5 to 8 minutes. If the dough sticks to the bowl or your hands like bubblegum,
            add a tablespoon of flour at a time until it’s easier to work with; avoid
            adding too much flour if possible.</li>
        <li>Option 1 — Use the dough right away. If you're in a hurry, skip the rise
            and make the pizza right now. It will make a thin-crusted pizza with a
            cracker-like flavor.</li>
        <li>Option 2 — Let the dough rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. If you're planning to
            make pizza today, then give the dough a rise. Clean out the mixing bowl, coat
            it with a little oil, and transfer the dough back inside. Cover the bowl with
            plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let the dough rise until doubled in size,
            1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Option 3 — Store the dough in the fridge. If you're planning to make pizza
            in the next few days, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and
            refrigerate. If you have time, let it rise for about a half an hour before you
            refrigerate it to get things going, but it will also be fine if you need to
            store it right away.</li>
        <li>Prepare the oven for baking. If your dough is refrigerated, take it out and
            let it warm on the counter while the oven heats or preferably 2 hours to come
            completely to room temperature. Arrange a rack in the bottom third of the oven.
            Place a baking stone or upside-down, heavy baking sheet on the rack. Heat the
            oven as hot as it will go, or at least 500°F.</li>
        <li>Prepare the pizzas. Divide the dough in half, and pat or roll one of the
            pieces into a 10-inch round. Transfer the round of dough to a floured baking
            peel, the back of a sheet pan, or a piece of parchment paper. Top with about
            1/4 cup of sauce, some cheese and any other toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 5 to 10 minutes. Slide the pizza into the oven on top of
            the baking stone or baking sheet. Bake until the cheese is melted, the crust
            golden, and you see a some charred bits on the top and edges, 5 to 10 minutes.
            Baking time will vary depending on the heat of your oven and how thick or thin
            you rolled your pizza.</li>
        <li>Cool (briefly!) and eat. Transfer the pizza to a cutting board. Let the
            pizza cool just enough so it won't burn your mouth when you take a bite before
            cutting. Meanwhile, top the remaining round of dough and bake it.</li>
      </ol>
