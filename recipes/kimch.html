<li>Cut the cabbage. Cut the cabbage lengthwise through the stem into quarters.
Cut the cores from each piece. Cut each quarter crosswise into 2-inch-wide
strips.</li>

<li>Salt the cabbage. Place the cabbage in a large bowl and sprinkle with the
salt. Using your hands, massage the salt into the cabbage until it starts to
soften a bit. Add enough water to cover the cabbage. Put a plate on top of the
cabbage and weigh it down with something heavy, like a jar or can of beans. Let
stand for 1 to 2 hours.</li>

<li>Rinse and drain the cabbage. Rinse the cabbage under cold water 3 times.
Set aside to drain in a colander for 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the
spice paste.</li>
